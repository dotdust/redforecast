I need to modify this function in order to:

Calculate the monthly forecast for each month that is passed as an argument.

The monthly forecast that we will call Unweighted Forecast will be obtained by dividing the value of each month
row by the sensitivity in the same row.

The monthly forecast that we will call Weighted Forecast will be the value of the month in the
corresponding row.

You will need also to calculate the split of the weighted and unweighted forecast using the percentages
in columns 'PPCC', 'PPE', 'PCPS', PCBE', 'Pdesign', 'PTech'. You should also calculate another split called
Others that will be consolidated in the split and that is represented by
(1 - The values of 'PPCC', 'PPE', 'PCPS', PCBE', 'Pdesign', 'PTech')
